# Fall-Time
A fun 2-D projectile motion simulator made with Tkinter

The program creates a visual representation of a 2-D projectile by taking in 3 parameters: Height, Speed, Angle and then applies them to basic kinematics formulas.

Height refers to the starting point of the projectile, while speed and angle are used to produce the velocity vector of the projectile.
